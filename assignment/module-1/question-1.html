<!-- Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing? -->/

<!-- elements:   They are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body is an element. -->
<!-- tags:       Tags are not the elements themselves, rather they're the bits of text you use to tell the computer where an element begins and ends.   -->
